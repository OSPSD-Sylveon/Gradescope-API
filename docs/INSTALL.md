## Setup

Clone/Fork the repository. This project currently uses [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/) for dependency management. If you do not plan to make any changes to the dependencies, you can use `pip` to install the dependencies instead.

Run at root of repository:

```bash
# PDM
pdm install
```

```bash
# pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
